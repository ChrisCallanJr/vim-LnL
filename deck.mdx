## What is Vim?

![quitting vim](./assets/quitting-vim.jpg) How to use Vim


---

<ul>
  <li>arrow keys to move around</li>
  <Appear>
    <li>"i" to type(insert mode)</li>
    <li>"Esc" when you're done</li>
    <li>":w" to save</li>
    <li>":q" to quit the file</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

---
This leads developers to ask questions like:

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>"What's up with hitting "i" every time I want to start typing?"</li>
    <li>"Why do I have to hit colon just to save or quit?"</li>
    <li>"Vim is just <i>too hard</i> to learn"</li>
    <li>And probably the biggest one...</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

## "What value does this give me over another editor?"

## Vim as a language

<i>"Your problem with Vim is that you don't grok vi."</i>

<Notes>
 From one of the most popular vim answers on SO
 In order to be proficient in vim, you have to learn to speak its language
</Notes>

Vim starts in <i>Normal</i> mode, and this is where we speak the language of Vim

<Notes>
  And as a developer, where we should be spending most of our time
  most developers are editing or modifying exsisting code in some way, which is why this is the Normal mode
</Notes>
